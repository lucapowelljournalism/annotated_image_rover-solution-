            <p>Malcolm X was a minister and black nationalist. He first moved to Harlem in 1943. He would return in March of 1954 to lead Temple Number 7, a Sunni Islam mosque on 130th St. The temple was destroyed in 1965, after Malcolm X's
              assassination.</p>

            <p>This quote from Malcolm X is actually a cut off version of the original, which reads “The only way we’ll get freedom for ourselves is to identify ourselves with every oppressed people in the world. We are blood brothers to the people
              of Brazil, Venezuelan Haiti and Cuba - yes, Cuba too." <p>
                <p> Malcolm X was very interested in Cuba, and famously arranged to meet Fidel Castro at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem in 1959.
                  <b><b> Malcolm was later quoted as saying that Fidel Castro was "the only white person he ever liked."</p>

    <!-- Our story -->
    <div class="container">
      <p>On the corner of 125th Street and Old Broadway, community members of all ages have banded together to paint a mural remembering two prominent local activists: Malcolm X and Yuri Kochiyama. The project site, once home to the Black-owned soul
        food restaurant and nightclub “Concerto West” and now a Columbia-owned building, has become the canvas for From Harlem with Love: A Mural Project for Yuri & Malcolm by way of hundreds of community volunteers in their effort to preserve the
        culture of West Harlem activism.</p>
